\section*{Code of Academic Integrity}

\footnotesize
Since the college is an academic community, its fundamental purpose is the pursuit of knowledge. Essential to the success of this educational mission is a commitment to the principles of academic integrity. Every member of the college community is responsible for upholding the highest standards of honesty at all times. Students, as members of the community, are also responsible for adhering to the principles and spirit of the following Code of Academic Integrity.

Activities that have the effect or intention of interfering with education, pursuit of knowledge, or fair evaluation of a student's performance are prohibited. Examples of such activities include but are not limited to the following definitions:

\paragraph{Cheating} Using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance, material, or study aids in examinations or other academic work or preventing, or attempting to prevent, another from using authorized assistance, material, or study aids. Example: using an unauthorized cheat sheet in a quiz or exam, altering a graded exam and resubmitting it for a better grade, etc.\\
\\
\noindent I acknowledge and agree to uphold this Code of Academic Integrity. \\~\\

\section*{Instructions}
This exam is 110 minutes (variable time per question) and closed-book. You are allowed \textbf{two} pages (front and back) of a \qu{cheat sheet}, blank scrap paper (provided by the proctor) and a graphing calculator (which is not your smartphone). Please read the questions carefully. Within each problem, I recommend considering the questions that are easy first and then circling back to evaluate the harder ones. No food is allowed, only drinks. %If the question reads \qu{compute,} this means the solution will be a number otherwise you can leave the answer in \textit{any} widely accepted mathematical notation which could be resolved to an exact or approximate number with the use of a computer. I advise you to skip problems marked \qu{[Extra Credit]} until you have finished the other questions on the exam, then loop back and plug in all the holes. I also advise you to use pencil. The exam is 100 points total plus extra credit. Partial credit will be granted for incomplete answers on most of the questions. \fbox{Box} in your final answers. Good luck!

\subquestionwithpoints{3} In the \texttt{flights} data frame, assume we drop all rows with \texttt{dep\_time} missing. After doing so, the \texttt{arr\_time} variable has very little missingness. The likely recommended procedure to do with the \texttt{arr\_time} variable then is to ... Circle one:\\ ~~drop it~~/~~impute it using the value $\xbar_j$~~/~~\iftoggle{solutions}{\inred{impute it using \texttt{missForest}}}{impute it using \texttt{missForest}}\\

Despite your answers above, in the \texttt{flights} data frame, we dropped all rows with \texttt{dep\_time} missing and then imputed all other values using \texttt{missForest}. And in the \texttt{planes} data frame, we dropped \texttt{speed} and then used listwise deletion. Here is the updated \texttt{skimr::skim} reports for the imputed data frames:

We now wish to build a model to predict $\y$ = \texttt{arr\_delay}, the numeric amount of time (in min.) that a flight is delayed (positive values of $y$ indicate the flight arrived late and negative values indicate the flight arrived early). We can only use features that we know in advance of the flight and we drop obviously useless features and obviously duplicative information. Below is the subset used with comments about what the variables mean compiled into matrix $\X$ and a \texttt{skimr::skim} report:

The first line is the answer to (i) plus the interactions among the four numeric variables. The next line is the numeric variables interacted with all the categorical variables' levels. The next line is carrier cross others; the next is origin cross others and the next is dest cross model and finally, the intercept. In class I erroneously stated that \texttt{R}'s \qu{. * .} notation includes squares (but it does not). So if you include the squares for the numeric variables, you would add four more to arrive at 17,396 and that would be marked correct.

We are going to do model selection, so we split the data into train-test:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
> n_train = 5000
> idx_train = sample(1 : n, n_train); idx_test = setdiff(1 : n, idx_train) 
> y_train = y[idx_train];             y_test = y[idx_test]
> X_train = X[idx_train, ];           X_test = X[idx_test, ]
\end{Verbatim}

Let's take a look at some simple models first in the training data. Remember since we took a subset, we may not have the same number of levels in the categorical variables as the entire dataset.

\subquestionwithpoints{3} If we were to do the model selection procedure using cross validation, would there likely need to be an \qu{outer loop}? Yes / no and explain your answer.

\iftoggle{solutions}{\inred{
No. The test set has $n - 5000 \approx 270,000$ observations. Thus, the stability of our oos measurement will be very good and thus there is no need to cross-validate.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A model $g$ for a real-world, non-man-made phenomenon $y$ which is a function of real-world measurements $x-1, \ldots, x-p$ could be absolutely true, (i.e. always have zero error when predicting in for future units).
\item A model $g$ for phenomenon $y$ can be proved true analytically (using a mathematical deductive proof).
\item A null model $g-0$ outputs a value in the set $\mathcal{Y}$.
\item A null model $g-0$ can still be \qu{useful} to the model's user.
\item Any model $g$ which is a function of real-world measurements $x-1, \ldots, x-p$ \textit{always} beats $g-0$ on predictive performance.
\item A model $g$ for phenomenon $y$ which is of type nominal categorical with possible values within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$ must return a value within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$.
\item A model $g$ for phenomenon $y$ which is of type nominal categorical with possible values within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$ must have a proxy $x-j$ which is also type nominal categorical with possible values within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$.

\item If $x-j$ is of type nominal categorical with possible values within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$, then it is reasonable when modeling that those categorical values should be replaced by $1, 2, \ldots, L$.

\item If $x-j$ is of type nominal categorical with possible values within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$, then it is reasonable when modeling that those categorical values should be replaced by $L-1$ binary variables indicating the presence of absence of categories $C-2, \ldots, C-L$.

\item If $x-j$ is of type ordinal with possible values within the set $C-1, C-2, \ldots, C-L$, assuming that set is ordered from smallest to largest, then it is reasonable when modeling that those categorical values \textit{can} be replaced by $1, 2, \ldots, L$.

\problem We measure the time (in months) between $n=60$ earthquakes. Here is a scatterplot of the raw data:

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{earthquake-plot.pdf}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

The time between earthquakes is known to be exponentially distributed. We suspect the distribution's mean changed once (at some point). So the DGP for the above data will be:

\beqn
X-1, X-2, \ldots, X-{\theta-3} \iid \theta-1 e^{-\theta-1 x} ~~\text{independent of}~~ X-{\theta-3 + 1}, X-{\theta-3 + 2}, \ldots, X-n \iid \theta-2 e^{-\theta-2 x}
\eeqn

\noindent For this problem, you may need to know some of these facts about the gamma distribution:

\beqn
Y \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta) := \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} y^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\beta y} \indic{y > 0}, ~~ F(y) = P(\alpha, \beta y),~~S(y) = Q(\alpha, \beta y)

As the \qu{real} $\thetahat$ distribution is centered to the right of the $\thetahat~|~H-0$ distribution, we must equate the right bound of the retainment region (from part f) to the 10\%ile of the distribution of $\thetahat$ and solve for the sample size $n$:

That completes the problem. But we'll need $\hat{\theta}-2^{MM}$ for the next problem, so we'll derive it here now by substituting $\hat{\theta}-1^{MM}$ for $\theta-1$:

\beqn
\theta-2 &=& \mu-1 (\theta-1 - 1) \\
&=& \mu-1 \parens{\frac{2\mu-2 -\mu-1^2}{\mu-2 - \mu-1^2} - 1} = \mu-1 \parens{\frac{2\mu-2 -\mu-1^2}{\mu-2 - \mu-1^2} - \frac{\mu-2 - \mu-1^2} {\mu-2 - \mu-1^2}} \\
\mathimplies \hat{\theta}-2^{MM} &=& \frac{\muhat-1\muhat-2}{\muhat-2 - \muhat-1^2}
